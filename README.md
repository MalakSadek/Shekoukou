The game is created using `Unreal Engine’s Blueprints`. Below is an example of what the Blueprints look like for the playable character, with a zoom in on one function to show an example of the logic used. In the background, these blueprints generate `C++` code to control the game’s logic.

The textures, objects, and characters are created using `Adobe Fuse` and animations are created using `Mixamo`. The map and scene were designed with Unreal Engine’s editor.
